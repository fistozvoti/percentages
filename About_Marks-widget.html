This Widget is built for Mathematics subjects, where a person doing Mathematics as a subject is given the opportunity to check their progress status if they Pass or Fail. The mark pass rate is set to 50% but students who do Maths as a subject are not aware of the mark pass rate that is set for this subject. So a person is given the chance to insert their names and percentages that they got from the subject, to check if they pass or not.
